## Introduction

OrbiTask Manager is a comprehensive task and project management application designed to enhance personal productivity through intelligent organization, visual workflows, and seamless collaboration. Built as a personal productivity tool, it combines the power of modern web technologies with an intuitive user experience to help manage tasks, projects, and team collaboration effectively.

### Project Goals

- **Personal Productivity**: Streamline task management and project planning
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built to handle growing complexity and feature requirements
- **Modern UX**: Intuitive interface with multiple viewing modes (Kanban, Calendar, List)
- **Extensibility**: Modular design for easy feature additions and customizations

## Technologies & Architecture

### Backend Stack

- **Node.js** with **TypeScript** - Type-safe server-side development
- **Express.js** - Fast, minimalist web framework
- **tRPC** - End-to-end typesafe APIs without code generation
- **MongoDB** with **Mongoose** - Flexible NoSQL database with elegant object modeling
- **JWT** - Secure authentication and authorization
- **Zod** - TypeScript-first schema validation

### Frontend Stack

- **React 18** - Modern component-based UI library
- **TypeScript** - Static type checking for better developer experience
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Shadcn/ui** + **Radix UI** - Accessible, customizable component library
- **React Query** - Powerful data synchronization for React
- **Zustand** - Lightweight state management
- **React Router** - Declarative routing for React

### Development & Quality Tools

- **ESLint** - Code linting and quality enforcement
- **Bun** - Fast JavaScript runtime and package manager (frontend)
- **React Hook Form** - Performant forms with easy validation
- **date-fns** - Modern JavaScript date utility library

### Why These Technologies?

**tRPC**: Chosen for its end-to-end type safety, eliminating the need for API documentation while ensuring frontend and backend stay in sync.

**MongoDB + Mongoose**: Selected for its flexibility in handling evolving data structures and its excellent JavaScript/TypeScript integration.

**Shadcn/ui + Radix**: Provides accessible, customizable components that maintain design consistency while allowing for extensive customization.

**Zustand**: Lightweight alternative to Redux that provides excellent TypeScript support with minimal boilerplate.

**Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first approach enables rapid UI development while maintaining design consistency.

### Feature-Based Architecture

The frontend follows a feature-based architecture where each feature contains:

- **Components**: UI components specific to the feature
- **Hooks**: Custom hooks for feature logic
- **Stores**: Zustand stores for state management
- **Types**: TypeScript interfaces and types
- **API**: tRPC client calls and data fetching

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
